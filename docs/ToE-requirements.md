# 🌴 Token of Exchange – Simulation Design

## Preface

*Once there was a serene island, far away from the mainland. The residents no longer remembered how or why they came to be there — only that they were ten, and the outside world was unknown to them. They lived quietly, self-sufficiently. Water was carried from the fountain, and each person cultivated their own small plot of land. There was no excess, no luxury. Just enough to sustain themselves.*

*Then, one day, the Elder of the village — in solemn conviction of a divine message — declared a new order:*

> *“From this day on, everyone must make their living through an abstraction called a* **workshop**. *And no one may trade without another abstraction, called a* **Token**. *This decree,” he claimed, “comes from above. Beware the wrath that shall follow if it is not obeyed.”*

*Thus began the age of the Token.*

**The question is:**  
*How will the Token system be implemented? Will it provide for everyone’s needs — or fail them? What consequences will follow each decision?*

## 🧭 Setting

An **isolated island** with:

- 10 Residents (including 1 Elder and 1 or more Traders)
- 1 Mint (Bank)
- 100 Tokens
- 1 or more workshops producing sustenance (the only essential good for the residents)

User interacts the simulation by selecting from different token- and other economy settings.

## 🎮 Simulation Modes

### 🔹 Foundational Mode *(Must-have)*

A minimalist simulation to explore how different token issuance systems affect productivity and life quality.

Focus Areas:

- Token creation methods (e.g., fiat, debt, fixed supply)
- Loan issuance and repayment cycles
- Employment dynamics and productivity
- Distribution of tokens among residents
- Basic needs: sustenance production and consumption
- Simple economy with one or few workshops and limited roles
- Effects of inflation or deflation on livelihood

### 🔸 Eco-Constraint mode

Adds ecological constraints to production and population.

**Key Variables:**

- Island Carrying Capacity (max sustainable sustenance production)
- Resource Depletion Rate
- Regeneration Rate
- Pollution Accumulation *(optional)*
- Population Growth

### 🔺 Multi-Island mode

Two or more islands compete via governance, trade, technology, and possibly military.  
Inspired by game theory dynamics.

**Features:**

- Competing governance systems
- Currency valuation & exchange
- Technological races
- Inter-island diplomacy or conflict

## ⚙️ Simulation Options

### 💰 Banking Systems

- **Gold Standard** – Fixed token supply, backed by scarce metal
- **Crypto-like** – Fixed supply, distributed issuance
- **Fiat** – Mint issues tokens via loans
- **Government-issued** – Sovereign non-debt token

### 🏛️ Governance Models

- **Elder Autocratic** – Central control. User can choose what companies are founded (You are the dictator -model).
- **Trader-led** – Free market leads, an automatic mechanism for individuals to start businesses based on their initiative capabilities. The individuals are looking **possibilities for profit**
- **Council** – Collective decision-making. The residents pleas are collected and either user or the Elder can execute new businesses based on *plea-metrics*. E.g. if shortage of something is spotted, the that shortage is then covered by applicable means.

### 🧾 Taxation Models

- **No Taxation** – Pure market-driven economy
- **Flat Tax** – A fixed percentage on all income or transactions
- **Progressive Tax** – Higher rates for wealthier residents
- **Wealth Tax** – Recurring tax on accumulated tokens
- **Consumption Tax** – Token cost on purchases (spending-based)
- **Resource Tax** (Eco Mode) – Token cost for exploiting natural resources

Optional configurations:

- Who collects it (Elder, Council, automated system)
- What it funds (redistribution, public projects, destruction/"burning")

### 🏗️ Company Types

In first phase only one type of goods:

- **Sustenance Production** – Food, basic needs

These types are introduced later:

- **Housing** – Population satisfaction
- **Luxury Goods** – Incentivize entrepreneurship (non-essential goods)

## 📊 Statistics & Charts

### 🔢 Economic Metrics

- **GDP**
- **GDP / Debt Ratio**
- **Public vs. Private Debt**
- **Exchange power** *(Inflation/Deflation)*
- **Total Token Supply**
- **Token Circulation Velocity**

### 🌿 Environmental Metrics *(in Environmental Model)*

- **Resource availability**
- **Regeneration vs. depletion trends**
- **Sustainability indicators**

## 💬 Simulation Feed

A live textual log of simulation events. Example:

*Resident 4 is hungry.
Resident 4 searches for a job.
Resident 4 begins self-employment.
Resident 4 hires Resident 6.
Resident 4 ceases
Resident 6 takes a loan
Resident 6 buys leaderless company*

etc. etc.

### 🧩 Chat Window Modes

- **Verbose** – Full activity feed
- **Summarized** – Only major events
- **Story Mode** – Adds personality:  
  *“Resident 4 dreams of building a bakery.”*

---

## 🌱 Possible Future Additions

- Random Events: Storms, tech breakthroughs, migration
- Trade between islands *(in Multi-Island mode)*
- Residents with AI-driven personalities (e.g. lazy, ambitious, collectivist)
- Education/Knowledge as an economic variable (an important factor!)
