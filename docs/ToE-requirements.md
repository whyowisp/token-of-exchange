# 🌴 Token of Exchange – Simulation Design

## 🧭 Setting

An **isolated island** with:

- 10 Habitants (including 1 Elder and 1 or more Entrepreneurs)
- 1 Bank
- 100 Tokens
- 1 Company producing food (the only essential good)

---

## 🎮 Simulation Scenarios

### 🔹 Basic Sim *(Must-have)*

A minimalist simulation to explore how different token issuance systems affect productivity and life quality.

Focus Areas:

- Token creation methods (e.g., fiat, debt, fixed supply)
- Loan issuance and repayment cycles
- Employment dynamics and productivity
- Distribution of tokens among habitants
- Basic needs: food production and consumption
- Simple economy with one or few companies and limited roles
- Effects of inflation or deflation on livelihood

### 🔸 Environmental Model

Adds ecological constraints to production and population.

**Key Variables:**

- Island Carrying Capacity (max sustainable food production)
- Resource Depletion Rate
- Regeneration Rate
- Pollution Accumulation *(optional)*
- Population Growth

### 🔺 Geopolitical Model

Two or more islands compete via governance, trade, technology, and possibly military.  
Inspired by game theory dynamics.

**Features:**

- Competing governance systems
- Currency valuation & exchange
- Technological races
- Inter-island diplomacy/conflict

## ⚙️ Simulation Options

### 💰 Banking Systems

- **Gold Standard** – Fixed token supply, backed by gold
- **Crypto-like** – Fixed supply, distributed issuance
- **Fiat** – Bank issues tokens via loans
- **Government-issued** – Sovereign non-debt money

### 🏛️ Governance Models

- **Elder Rule** – Central control
- **Entrepreneurial** – Free market leads
- **Council** – Collective decision-making

### 🏗️ Company Types

- **Sustenance Production** – Food, basic needs
- **Housing** – Population satisfaction
- **Status Items** – Incentivize entrepreneurship (non-essential goods)

## 📊 Statistics & Charts

### 🔢 Economic Metrics

- **GDP**
- **GDP / Debt Ratio**
- **Public vs. Private Debt**
- **Token Value** *(Inflation/Deflation)*
- **Total Token Supply**
- **Token Velocity**

### 🌿 Environmental Metrics *(in Environmental Model)*

- Resource availability
- Regeneration vs. depletion trends
- Sustainability indicators

## 💬 Simulation Feed – Chat Window

Textual log of simulation events. Example:

*Habitant 4 is hungry.
Habitant 4 searches for a job.
Habitant 4 begins self-employment.
Habitant 4 hires Habitant 6.
Habitant 4 eats.*

### 🧩 Chat Window Modes

- **Verbose** – Full activity feed
- **Summarized** – Only major events
- **Story Mode** – Adds personality:  
  *“Habitant 4 dreams of building a bakery.”*

---

## 🌱 Possible Future Additions

- Random Events: Storms, tech breakthroughs, migration
- Trade between islands *(in Geopolitical Model)*
- Habitants with AI-driven personalities (e.g. lazy, ambitious, collectivist)
- Education/Knowledge as an economic variable
